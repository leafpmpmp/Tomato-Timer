A simple tomato timer, now with a new UI under construction. (No ETA, but hopefully before Sep.)

Python
```
winget install python
```
or get it from [Python.org](www.python.org) (or Microsoft store on Windows)

PyQt5
```
pip install PyQt5
```
## Run
Just run it with `python "path/to/the/Tomato-Timer.py"`. If you don't want to see the console window, rename the file ```*.py``` to ```*.pyw``` before executing it.
